However, generally speaking, a look of surprise on someone's face is usually indicated by raised eyebrows, wide-open eyes, and sometimes an open mouth. The person might also show signs of tension in their facial muscles or have a posture that suggests they've encountered something unexpected. If you can provide a larger or clearer image, I could give you a more accurate description."

However, please note that I can't see a real person in the image; it seems to be an illustration or icon of a stylized face.\n\nTypically, a sad expression might include downward-turning corners of the mouth, drooping eyebrows, and eyes that might appear glossy or teary. The overall facial expression often appears less animated and more subdued when a person feels sad. In this particular illustration, the large eyes with downward curving outer edges and the slight downturn to the mouth might give the impression of a sad or melancholic expression."
